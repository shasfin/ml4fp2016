benchmarks you could generate (if you had time...)

take n: something with foldnat head and con? No, does not work.
drop n: you already have it in enumFromTo: something with foldnat tail, yep.
is_nil: is_zero (length xs)
delete x xs: filter (neq x) xs, nope, not going to do this one
is_even: you already had it, foldnat with not, starting with true or false gives is_even or is_odd
evens: filter with is_even
dropmaxes: map dropmax
nth n xs = head (drop n xs) let's see.
