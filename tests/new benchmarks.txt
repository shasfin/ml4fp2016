benchmarks you could generate (if you had time...)

take n: something with foldnat head and con?
drop n: you already have it in enumFromTo: something with foldnat tail
is_nil: is_zero (length xs)
delete x xs: filter (neq x) xs
is_even: you already had it, foldnat with not, starting with true or false gives is_even or is_odd
evens: filter with is_even
dropmaxes: map dropmax
