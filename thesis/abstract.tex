We investigate the benefits of providing a relatively large library of components to a program synthesiser. Library components encode well-known computational patterns that human programmers reuse in their programs. We target the synthesis of functional straight-line programs from input-output examples. We implement a basic synthesis algorithm based on best-first enumeration combined with type-based pruning. We use heuristics to guide the search and black lists to prune the search space. We have evaluated our prototype implementation on simple algorithmic problems over a library of $37$ components. Results indicate that our basic algorithm performs not considerably worse that much more sophisticated state-of-the-art algorithms.
