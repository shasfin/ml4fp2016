Contributions:

- 
- different program expansion strategies:
  * queue of open holes (hole with the smalles number first)
  * stack of open holes (leftmost hole first)
- different cost functions in the priority queue
  * standard queue without priority
  * based on the number of nodes
  * length of the program as a string
  * based on the number of nodes and the size of the implicit types
  * number of holes (fewer holes first)
- black list
  * automatic black list
    slow (bad examples)
    only identity pruning (I generate identity, actually one could try to generate also other things like nil, b_zero, b_succ b_zero and so on than prune all except for the first one)
    many repetitions ("append (append nil nil) _" is already ruled out by "append nil")
  * manual black list
    inspired by the automatic one




- pure implementation:
  * set up (interpreter for System F and so on, mostly code written by Dimitar)
  * unification
  * built-in integers and functions
  * practical library format (not that practical for adding built-in functions, poor error handling)
