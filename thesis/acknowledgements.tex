\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank all people that helped me during the past six months. In particular, my supervisor Dimitar Dimitrov for his support, his valuable feedback and his help. I would also like to thank Professor Martin Vechev for giving me the possibility to work on this interesting project and Denise Spicher for encouraging me to continue this thesis.

I would like to thank everybody in our room for the great interactions. Special thanks in particular to Gagandeep Singh for the delicious cookies and of course his help with table formatting.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and my friends, who always supported me and showed great patience in proofreading this document.
