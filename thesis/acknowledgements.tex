\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank all people that helped me during the past six months. In particular, my supervisor Dimitar Dimitrov for his support, his valuable feedback and his help. I would also like to thank Professor Martin Vechev for giving me the possibility to work on this interesting project and Denise Spicher for encouraging me to continue this thesis.

Next, I would like to thank the people in my room for socially interacting with me. In particular, I would like to thank Gagandeep Singh for the cookies, they were delicious. And of course for his help with table formatting.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and my friends, who always supported me and had the patience to proofread this document more often than I did.
